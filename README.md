A privacy-focused research tool that combines:
- **Venice.ai's Uncensored Language Models**: Access to powerful AI models without content restrictions
- **Brave Search's Private Search API**: Privacy-respecting web search capabilities

## Why This Matters üîí

In today's AI landscape, privacy often takes a backseat to functionality. This project proves it doesn't have to be that way:

- **True Privacy**: Your research queries stay private with Brave Search's no-logging policy
- **Uncensored Research**: Access Venice.ai's unrestricted models for genuine research freedom
- **Local Processing**: Keep sensitive data on your machine, not in the cloud
- **Transparent Code**: 100% open source, audit everything yourself

This project is a privacy-focused fork of [deep-research](https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research) by [@dzhng](https://github.com/dzhng), enhanced to prioritize user privacy and unrestricted research capabilities. Our research strategies were inspired by [open-deep-research](https://github.com/btahir/open-deep-research) by [@btahir](https://github.com/btahir), though we've taken a different approach focused on privacy and local processing.

## Quick Demo üé•

Try the interactive demo at [georgeglarson.github.io/deep-research-privacy](https://georgeglarson.github.io/deep-research-privacy)

Features you can try:
- Research privacy topics with uncensored AI
- Compare different AI models
- Experience our privacy-first approach

## The Coolest Part? Run It Your Way! üöÄ

This project is designed to be super flexible - you can run the exact same code in two ways:

1. **Direct Node.js:** Install dependencies locally and run directly
2. **Docker Container:** Run everything in an isolated container with zero Node.js installation required!

Both methods use the exact same code and configuration (.env file), just in different environments. Choose what works best for you!

## How We Compare üìä

### Comparison with Traditional Tools

| Feature | Deep Research Privacy | Traditional Research Tools | Other AI Assistants |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Privacy First | ‚úÖ No data collection | ‚ùå Tracks searches | ‚ùå Stores conversations |
| Uncensored Results | ‚úÖ Full access | ‚ùå Filtered results | ‚ùå Content restrictions |
| Open Source | ‚úÖ 100% transparent | ‚ùå Closed source | ‚ùå Proprietary |
| Local Processing | ‚úÖ Your machine | ‚ùå Cloud-based | ‚ùå Cloud-based |
| Cost | ‚úÖ Pay per use | ‚ùå Expensive subscriptions | ‚ùå Monthly fees |

### Comparison with OpenAI's Deep Research

In the interest of transparency, here's how our implementation differs from OpenAI's deep research tool:

| Feature | OpenAI Deep Research | Deep Research Privacy |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Model | OpenAI o3 (optimized for data analysis) | Venice.ai models (general purpose) |
| Input Types | Text, images, PDFs, spreadsheets | Text only (web search results) |
| Research Strategy | End-to-end reinforcement learning | Fixed breadth/depth tree structure |
| Path Planning | Dynamic with backtracking | Static with predefined paths |
| Output Format | Comprehensive reports with embedded data | Basic learnings and sources lists |
| Integration | Built into ChatGPT | Standalone command-line tool |
| Privacy Focus | Cloud-based processing | Local processing, privacy-first |

While our tool may not match all of OpenAI's features, we prioritize:
- Privacy and local processing
- Transparent, open-source implementation
- Uncensored research capabilities
- User control over data and processing

## Getting Started

First, you'll need to get API keys:

1. **Venice.ai API Key**
   - Go to [Venice.ai](https://venice.ai/chat?ref=VB8W1j)
   - Sign up for an account
   - Navigate to your API settings
   - Generate a new API key

2. **Brave Search API Key**
   - Visit [Brave Search API](https://api.search.brave.com/app)
   - Create a developer account
   - Go to [API Keys](https://api.search.brave.com/app/keys)
   - Generate a new API key

Then set up your configuration:

```bash
# Copy example files
cp .env.example .env
cp config.json.example config.json

# Edit both files with your API keys:
# 1. .env - For environment variables
# 2. config.json - For application configuration
```

Now you can run the project using either method:

### Option 1: Direct Node.js
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run with default settings
npm start

# Or run with custom query
QUERY="your research question" npm start
```

### Option 2: Docker Container
```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t deep-research .

# Run interactively
docker run -it deep-research

# Or run with a specific query
docker run -it -e QUERY="your research question" deep-research

# Or run with a specific model
docker run -it -e VENICE_MODEL=llama-3.2-3b deep-research
```

The Docker method is perfect for trying out the project without installing Node.js!

Available models:
- `llama-3.3-70b`: Latest general purpose model
- `llama-3.2-3b`: Fast, efficient model
- `dolphin-2.9.2-qwen2-72b`: Uncensored model
- `llama-3.1-405b`: Most intelligent model
- `qwen32b`: Code-optimized model
- `deepseek-r1-llama-70b`: DeepSeek's distilled model
- `deepseek-r1-671b`: DeepSeek's largest model

That's it! Choose whichever method is easier for you - they both run the exact same code.
