# Contributing to Deep Research: Privacy Edition

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Deep Research as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Add yourself to CONTRIBUTORS.md if you're making your first contribution
7. Issue that pull request!

## Getting Credit for Your Contributions

We want to recognize everyone who helps make Deep Research better! When making your first contribution:

1. Add yourself to [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) in your pull request
2. Include a brief description of your contribution
3. Your entry will automatically appear in both the README and About page

This helps us maintain a single source of truth for all contributors and ensures everyone gets proper credit for their work.

## Any contributions you make will be under the ISC Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [ISC License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/isc/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/coolcline/deep-research-privacy/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/coolcline/deep-research-privacy/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use TypeScript for all source files
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Run `npm run format` to ensure consistent code formatting
